## About Me

I'm a Full Stack Developer and Computer Engineer focused on building robust, scalable, and high-performance solutions. I work mainly with React.js, Next.js, NestJS, and React Native, building APIs, modern UIs, and microservices.

Currently expanding my knowledge in Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD practices, with a strong interest in system architecture and product scalability.

I'm always open to opportunities and collaborations.
